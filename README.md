# TallyThoseThings
A clean but feature rich, self-contained, tally/counter application.

If you want to save a version of this application the best option is to go to the [website](https://towerofawesome.org/tallythosethings/) and save the page as an html file. The reason for this is of course that the page file in the repository contains PHP code which would have to be stripped out first, though this is also an option.
